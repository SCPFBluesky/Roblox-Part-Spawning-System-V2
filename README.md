# Roblox-Part-Spawning-System-V2
This system replaces the default roblox spawning system by using specific parts within the workspace instead of traditional roblox spawn points. which could bug out. This approach aims to improve the reliability of player spawning and address certain engine bugs, such as players occasionally spawning on rooftops in certian buildings, this system was orgingally designed for Site-24 to fix that exact issue i've decided to make it open source for everyone to use, as I think it would be useful for other people to have.
Github was made for user Forks.
